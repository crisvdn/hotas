This is a simple profile for the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog.
The profile provides functionality to the LED's and they will respond to user input of flip switches and throttle management.

Running the profile creates a new "virtual" USB device. This means you have to reconfigure your keys in DCS/ the game you want to play.

HOW TO USE:
1. Download Thrustmaster T.A.R.G.E.T software. [Download link](https://github.com/crisvdn/hotas/archive/refs/tags/1.0.zip)
2. Click "Run configuration"
3. Select the "warthog_keybinds.fcf" file
4. Enjoy!
